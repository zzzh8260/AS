To run the simulation, run the script "lab1.py"

To change the parameters of the controller, so that you can implement different vehicles, edit "params.yaml".
In this file, you can also enable/disable the different kinds of noise (white, brown and spike), as well as
some parameters which belong to the simulation itself.

One simulation parameter which you might want to adjust as soon as you begin is "screen_width".
This parameter actually sets the height as well as the width of the square shaped simulation window.
On my laptop, 800 is not bad, but on a larger screen you may be able to go to 1000 or higher and get
a better view of what is happening.
